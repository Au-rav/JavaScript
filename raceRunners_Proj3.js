/*There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) 
and youth runners (under 18 years of age). 
They can register early or late. 
Runners are assigned a race number and 
start time based on their age and registration. 


Race number:

Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:

Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).*/
